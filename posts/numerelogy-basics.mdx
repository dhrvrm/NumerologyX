### 3. Soul Urge Number

The Soul Urge Number, or Heart’s Desire Number, is derived from the vowels in your full birth name and reveals your innermost desires and motivations. It provides insights into what you truly want from life and what drives you on a deeper level.

### 4. Personality Number

The Personality Number is calculated from the consonants in your full birth name and represents how others perceive you. It provides insights into your outward behavior and the impression you make on others.

## How to Calculate Your Core Numerology Numbers

### 1. Life Path Number

To calculate your Life Path Number, add the digits of your birth date together until you reach a single digit or a Master Number (11, 22, 33). For example, if you were born on July 25, 1985:

- Birthdate: 07/25/1985
- Add the digits: 7 + 2 + 5 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 5 = 37
- Reduce to a single digit: 3 + 7 = 10, 1 + 0 = 1
- Life Path Number: 1

### 2. Expression Number

To calculate your Expression Number, assign numerical values to each letter in your full birth name (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.), sum the values, and reduce to a single digit or Master Number.

### 3. Soul Urge Number

To calculate your Soul Urge Number, add the numerical values of the vowels in your full birth name, sum them up, and reduce to a single digit or Master Number.

### 4. Personality Number

To calculate your Personality Number, assign numerical values to the consonants in your full birth name, sum the values, and reduce to a single digit or Master Number.

### 5. Maturity Number

Combine the Life Path Number and Expression Number, then reduce to a single digit or Master Number if necessary.
